This is a sinlge player only version of [The Game of Sim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim_(pencil_game))


## state of the AI
According to the article linked above, the second player can always win with perfect play. Currently the CPU player plays second, and it can be beaten. My purpose for this project is research for developing a tool for creating strategy games, not developing game AI, so don't expect this to change anytime soon. Contributions are welcome however!
